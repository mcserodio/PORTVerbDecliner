24 Nov 2023 - present: Brazilian Portuguese imperative verb decliner
For now, this only deals with regular, non-stem-changing verbs
Start with just imperatives too for now

Main Program: create new chart (in old or existing txt file), view existing charts, modify existing charts, delete charts, irregular Vs

-- use bitwise algebra to unlock user "permissions" to perform certain actions
before they're able to save a chart (e.g. must pass 6/6 test for a declined verb
before they can save the declined data) --> turn this into a level-up game?
DEFAULT PERMISSION 10000 (to take test, view V chart, save chart, view all saved charts,
delete existing chart; must perform (1) to unlock 2|3|4; must perform 3 to unlock
5 (maybe use ^ XOR for relationship betweeen 3 and 5?)

Next goal: address stem-changing verbs. Some are simple enough that you can put
"if inf[-3]=='c', --> c com ce cegilia", but I want to also make it so that the
program can recognize "if the first vowel is __, it must change to another vowel
__ in these cases", even if that vowel appears in different indexes for different
verb stems

For stem-changing Vs, I want to t try reverse indexing (from -1) and use .find() to,
for example, find the final "c" in conhecer --> the final c gets an accent to รง
in the eu form. If I use .find() normally, it'll return the first index in which it
occurs, which may not be the right occurrence of 'c' that needs to change in the stem

Idea for new feature: use verb decliner to receive a Portuguese text as input, then
output a version of that text that takes place in a different time by changing the tense
of Vs in the text.
- maybe use doubly linked lists w/ pointers between certain tenses so that each diff. tense
within the text is re-declined to the right corresponding time frame?
- e.g. OG text w/ present and future Vs, when rewritten to have happened in the past,
will (respectively) return perfect and present verbs.
- Problem: some non-verb words may resemble declined verbs, e.g. "churrasco" has a
similar ending to 1st person present singular verbs, but is a noun. How do I deal with this?
--> tell user to mark up the their data by writing '*' char before each verb?
The program should then look for each occurrence of '*' (may need to remove each occurrence
after declining the V) and parse the word (ending at the next occurrence of a space) for
its verb form.
- Problem: what if the vowel stem of the verb ending isn't obvious from the declined form?
e.g. '-o' ending doesn't tell you if it's an ar/er/ir verb.

Miscellaneous ideas:
- future tense
- subjunctive/indicative moods
- ability to have random infinitive/tense chosen for user (using random.randint & list of vocab)
- let user view a specific form of a verb (instead of whole chart)
- ask to read what the uses of diff. tenses are (e.g. when to use imperfect vs perfect)
- irregular stems (non-stem-changing)
